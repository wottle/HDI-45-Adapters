# HDI-45-Adapters

## The History
These adapters are for Macintosh 6100/7100/8100 computers with [HDI-45](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDI-45_connector) ports to get VGA or DA-15 video output. Apple, for a very brief period, created computers where the video out (and other signals) were combined into a single port, known affectionately as HDI-45.  I know, you may be saying, "they did this again with Apple Desktop Connector.  Also, technically Thunderbolt does this..."  And you would be correct.  However both of those connections lasted a long time and we have multiple options for monitors that support that connection.  With the HDI-45 port, Apple made exactly one monitor that used this connector.  The [Apple AudioVision 14 Display](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_AudioVision_14_Display):

This allowed owners to plug their keyboard and mouse, headphones, and a microphone into the monitor. The monitor also contained two large speakers in the chin of the device.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cf/Apple_AudioVision_14_Display.png)

This monitor did not sell well, and they are much more rare than the Macintosh 6100, 7100, and 8100 machines that came with the native port.  Additionally, some machines, like the 6100 DOS Compatible version, required a DA-15 monitor connection to plug into the Y cable that allowed for switching between the Macintosh environment and the DOS environment. At the time, Apple provided an adapter with every 6100 (non-AV) sold.  Sadly, those adapters likely have become separated from the machines they came with, and the adapters are now relatively hard to find and are not cheap.  

## My Motivation

Recently, I purchased a "barn find" batch of filthy computers.  In this mass of filth, there were 14 PowerMac 6100s in the 58 Macs I picked up.  There was a box containing a Rat's nest of mice (I believe there were mayber 30 ADB mice).  Any guess on how many HDI-45 to DA-15 adapters there were in this haul?  If you guessed zero, you would be right.  However, I wanted to clean and fix up these machines to get them back in a working and useful state.  So I started researching if I could buy ten or so of these adapters (I was foolishly optimistic that 10 of these machines would be salvageable - there was appartently a flood where these were stored).  Sadly, I could only find a couple of these for sale and they were typically going for more than $35-40 on the auction sites.  I did not want to put $350-400 into these machines, so I started researching this HDI-45 port and trying to see if there were any DIY adapters.  Unfortunately, there were no solutions at the time (Jan 2025).  Vut I did find [the pinout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDI-45_connector#Technical) for it.  

## Making it Happen 

### Initial Ideas 

I started [a thread on TinkerDifferent](https://tinkerdifferent.com/threads/need-solution-for-hdi-45-to-db-15-connectors-for-video-out.4056/), and began brainstorming ideas.  Originally, I was thinking of a small PCB the size of the port with headers.  The backside of the PCB would be soldered wires that would connect to another PCB which would house the DA-15 connector.  From there, you could connect any vintage DA-15 Apple Monitor, or use one of the readily available DA-15 to VGA adapters. 

However, the idea of soldering tiny wires to a PCB when the pins were 2.0mm pitch seemed unreasonable.  So I started trying to see if we could de-solder the HDI-45 connector from the board and replace it with a PCB and a DA-15 right angle port. However, trying to build something sturdy enough to handle plugging and unplugging that would also fit in the existing opening would be a significant challengs.  It also is incredibly hard to de-solder 45 pint and 4 large ground connections.  

### The Final Design Comes to Life

However, the idea was floated to do an offset adapter that could have pins on the backside of the board that would be aligned with the HDI-45 holes.  Traces would route the necessary signals to the DA-15 connector and shift it off to the side to avoid the expansion port screw that would be used for something like the DOS Comparible card.  Additionally, it was decided that it would be incredibly simple to just have the adapter output VGA, since for these machines, it would just mean a diode between two of the sense lines.  However, I still wanted to make a DA-15 version because that is needed for older monitors and if the owner wants to use the DOS Compatible Card with the Y cable. 

### Getting the details right
I measured the pin spacing on the female HD-45 port and replicated that on a PCB (I have no PCB design knowledge, so it was not efficient.  I then needed to figure out how to get the right header pins.  I knew the horizontal spacing is 2.0mm, but the vertical is less than that.  Also, on the right, some of the pins are 2.54mm pitch.  I originally planned to try to install pins in all the used pins, and then add pins where needed to ensure the pins could not be inserted incorrectly.  I also needed pins long enough to reach into the port, which sits pretty deeply recessed from the plastic back plate the PCB would need to clear.  Ultimately, I learned that no set of pins would completely eliminate the chance of being inserted offeset to the right.  With longer pins having more deflection chance, it wasn't going to guarantee correct insertion. The pins I decided on where 2.0mm pitch headers that were 19mm long. I had also envisioned a 3d printed case for this, but didn't believe I could print a fake shield that would fit into the port and still be sturdy enough to not break on insertion and removal.  However, I really felt it would improve the experience of using the adapter to have a shroud that would guide the pins into the correct holes.  So I build a mockup in TinkerCad, printed it out, and surprisingly it worked on the first try (never built anything in TinkerCAD before this either!). 

So, with a 3d printed case, a PCB, some long pins, a diode for the VGA version, and female connectors for the appropriate monitor cable, we had something that resembled an adapter.  I ordered a run of both versions of the PCBs, and when they arrived, I was able to get more precise measurements and finalized the 3d cases.  I soldered the pins, diode, and connectors and they worked perfectly.  With the 3d printed case, I had to go through a couple iterations to get the alignment just right to ensure the pins would go in smoothly, but I have them working very well on my 3D printer.  Given the small tolerances, I do worry about how well they'll work on other people's printers.  I am ordering a batch printed in resin from JLC3DP to see how they fit.  Will update the STLs accordingly. 

## Current State

I want to make sure this design can live on for others in the future.  I'm releasing the gerbers, 3d files, and instructions so people that want to make these can on their own. However, the license requires attribution and is only available for non-commercial use.  I'm partnering with someone for distribution in the US.  My goal is to make these available for DIY enthusiasts with the ability to make these, but to sell through a trusted source for people that lack the tools to do it themselves, for much cheaper than the Apple adapters.  If you want to distribute these elsewhere in the world commercially, let me know and we can work out something.  I want other make sure they are reasonably priced.  I did try to make these in a cost conscious way, although there's not much I could control cost wise other than making the 3d prints efficient, the PCB small, and choosing relatively cheap header pins (some pins I looked into using were nearly $1 per pin, so I scrapped that idea.  If anyone needs really nice 13mm gold plated pins, let me know!

### Estimated Cost
Overall, with PCBs ordered at minimum quantity of 5 from JLCPBC, the 5 PCBs would cost about $4-5 shipped to the US.  Diodes are cheap, mabe $0.10 each The headers unfortunately only come in large packs, and will likely cost you $7 or so, but you'll have enough to make a ton.  So if you buy some, offer them up on TinkerDifferent or 68kMLA forums to others who might be able to use your leftovers.  Finally, the connectors, the most expensive parts, are going to cost you around $2, plus shipping if you can't find locally or ship with other items.  

But if you make multiple, you can get these for anywhere from about $5 to $15 depending on efficiencies of scale.
