Assembling the header pins will likely be the only challenging part of this process.  This page gives some pictures to show my technique for getting the pins soldered in and aligned properly. 

As stated in the advanced instructions, I use a HDI-45 port as an alignment jig. 

First, start by laying out the components:

Start by inserting the 4 single header pins into the appropriate holes in the HDI-45 port in rows 2 and 4. I find it easiest to get these out of the way first.

Then, take the 3-pin header strip and insert it in the middle row 3, in between the two rose of individual pins.

Now add one of the 4-pin header strips in row 1 or 5.  It doesn't matter which one.

With the 4 rows added, let's lay the PCB down on the pins, starting with the 4 pin row we just added.   With the PCB at an angle, get the 4 pins on the first row in the holes on the PCB.  Then maneuver the PCB onto the next row of pins, as you angle the PCB towards the remaining rows of pins.  When you have all the pins aligned with their PCB holes, push down on the PCB to get all the pins properly set, as shown here:

Now is the time to solder these 4 rows to the PCB.  When finished, remove the PCB and headers from the HDI-45 port and flip the PCB over to inspect the header pins.  Make sure they all look evenly spaced.
