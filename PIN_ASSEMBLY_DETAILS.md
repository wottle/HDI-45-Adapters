Assembling the header pins will likely be the only challenging part of this process.  This page gives some pictures to show my technique for getting the pins soldered in and aligned properly. 

As stated in the advanced instructions, I use a HDI-45 port as an alignment jig. 

First, start by laying out the components: 
![Picture of the components needed to complete this project. On the table there is a HDI-45 female port, a set of header pins, the PCB, and a DA-15 connector.](/images/0_the_components.jpeg)

Start by inserting the 4 single header pins into the appropriate holes in the HDI-45 port in rows 2 and 4. I find it easiest to get these out of the way first.

Then, take the 3-pin header strip and insert it in the middle row 3, in between the two rose of individual pins.

Now add one of the 4-pin header strips in row 1 or 5.  It doesn't matter which one.

With the 4 rows added, let's lay the PCB down on the pins, starting with the 4 pin row we just added.   With the PCB at an angle, get the 4 pins on the first row in the holes on the PCB.  Then maneuver the PCB onto the next row of pins, as you angle the PCB towards the remaining rows of pins.  When you have all the pins aligned with their PCB holes, push down on the PCB to get all the pins properly set, as shown here:

Now is the time to solder these 4 rows to the PCB.  When finished, remove the PCB and headers from the HDI-45 port and flip the PCB over to inspect the header pins.  Make sure they all look evenly spaced.

Finally, insert the final 4-pin header strip into the final row.

Solder that final row of header pins.  If creating the HD-15 version, add the diode now and solder it in place, taking note of the direction.  The PCB markings will show where the side of the diode goes that has the white strip.
Now insert the appropriate connector for your build, flip the PCB over and solder the pins as well as the sheild grounding points:

With all components soldered in place, I'd recommend cleaning the flux with some isopropyl alcohol.  

If you have your 3D printed case, you can test fit by holding the PCB in your hand with the 3d-printed case bottom against it.

Test the alignment by inserting into a HDI-45 port.
